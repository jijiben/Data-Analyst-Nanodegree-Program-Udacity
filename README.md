## Nanodegree Orientation

How to succeed on the program ?
* Remember to put in time consistently;
* Engage with your community;
* Take advantage of the resources available to you;
* Give us feedback throughout the program;

## P0: Analyze Chopstick Length (Optional)
### Intro to research methods

#### For a survey trust results:
* Good simple size
* Representative sample
* Sound methodology(;How the survey was conducted)
#### construct definition
We are able to meassure a construct if we have an operational definition.
```
operational definition: Percent of faces correctly recognized on  a memory test
Construct: Memory 
```
#### Data
Survey is more reliable whenfactors are held constant.
Extraneous factors(lurking variables) can impact the ourcam ans we may not have thought about. We should be aware of those factors when analizing data.
### Sample average
"Population parameters (such as mu, or \mu) are values that describe the entire population. Sample statistics (such as X-bar, or \bar x 
x
¯
 ) are values that describe our sample; we use statistics to estimate the population parameters. Estimates are our best guesses for the population parameters. So, for example, we would use X-bar to estimate mu."

### Randomness

"Begin with an illustration. Perhaps the best typical example that we can give of the scientiﬁc meaning of random distribution is afforded by the arrangement of the drops of rain in a shower. No one can give a guess where abouts at any instant a drop will fall. but we know that if we put out a sheet of paper in will gradually become uniformly spotted over; and that if we were to mark out any of two equal ereas on the paper these would gradually tend to be struck equally often.
".The Logic of Chance by John Venn

### visualize relationship
f(x) = y; X = independent/predictor variable and y = dependent variable / outcome

### Golden Arches Theory of conflict prevention, Thomas Friedman
```
No two countries with a McDonald's have ever gone to war since opening the McDonald's.
```
#### Correlation does not imply causation
### causal inference
show relationships between variables:
* observational studies (Existing data)
* Survey (look for and make data)
show causation:
* Controlled experiment
##### notes
* When respndnar not undersatnd the question => Response bias
* when respondent refusing to ansswer = > Non-response bias
* blind is an experiment in which information about the test is masked from the participant, to reduce or eliminate bias.
* double blind : researchers dont know which treatment participants recieved 
* Placebo: fake treatement
* observatioanl studies / survey / experiments; best to proove causality
