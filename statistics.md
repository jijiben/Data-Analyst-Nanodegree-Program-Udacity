# Statistics
## PS 1a Intro to research methods
### Notes
 Parameter: A number that describes a population.
 statistic: A number that describes a sample.
 Sampling error: Difference between the sample and the population average.
Quiz : Done
## PS 1b: Additional Practice(Optional)
### Notes 
* Hypotheses: statements about the relationships between variables
* Lurking variables can result in a correlation between two variables that are not causally related. 
* Including placebo control condition help us to identify the presence of lurking variables.
Quiz : Done
## L2: Visualizing Data
* Interval = bin = bucket:  group of data
* bin size: the interval in which you're counting the frequency
* Data https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FhX_MCkqiXPVArIZi5pO9xPpftHzmqeuY4KbS5qQMv8/edit#gid=0 ,Histogram http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/Histogram/
* Histogram : possibility to choose any bin size
              The variables on the x-axis is numerical and quantitive.
* Bar graph : distinct category
              The variables on the x-axis is categorical and qualitative
* Normal distribution has one peak called the mode.
* Positively skewed disctribution : Most values are on the left side than on the right .
## PS 2a: visualizing Data
* The Σ symbol means the total sum. It is the Greek letter capital sigma. f stands for frequency (count), p stands for proportion.
* With frequency tables, we have exact counts, so we can always create the histogram.But not the opposite way around.

## L3: Central Tendency
Mode: The value at which frequency is highest
Median: Value in the middle
Average: statisctic that rest at a specific spot in the middle of the distribution.
Uniform distribution have no mode
multi-modal distribution is when there are two or more distinct clear trends.
### Note:
* The data doesn't need to be numeric to find a mode: we can also compute the mode for categorical data as well! 
* The sample mean formula is: x̄ = ( Σ xi ) / n
* The population mean formula is: μ = (Σ * X)/ N where: Σ means “the sum of.” X = all the individual items in the group. N = the number of items in the group
* "The mean will change if we add an extreme value to the dataset." is not necessarily a property of the mean, more a behavioral tendency.
* Many samples from the same population will have similar means.
* The average can be misleading when we have outliers(; values that are unexpectedly different from the other observed values.
* Put data in order to make the median a useful statistic.
* When we cant have two median (n is even) then the median is the value between those two medians.
* outlier affect median and mean.this tendency of meadian is called Robust;strong and sturdy
* Measures of center : Mean, Median(best measure of central tendency when dealing with highly skewed distribution) , Mode
* In a positively skewed distribution:  mode < median < mean
* Symmetrical distribution(normal distribution of data) : mode = median = mean
### Median:
Median value in symbol for any dataset with n values
If n even: [(n/2) + (n/2 +1)]/2
else : (n+1)/2
## PS 3a: Central Tendency
* median is not affected by extrem outliers
Quiz: Done
## PS 3b: Central Tendency(additional practice, optional)
* There is no mode; no most frequency value since each value apears exactly once
* Median is the measure of center that say is better for skewed distributions
Quiz: Done
