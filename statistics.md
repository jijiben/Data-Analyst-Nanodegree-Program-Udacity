### Notes 
* Hypotheses: statements about the relationships between variables

* Including placebo control condition help us to identify the presence of lurking variables.

## L2: Visulizing Data
* Interval = bin = bucket:  group of data
* bin size: the interval in which you're counting the frequency
* Data https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FhX_MCkqiXPVArIZi5pO9xPpftHzmqeuY4KbS5qQMv8/edit#gid=0 ,Histogram http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/Histogram/
* Histogram : possibility to choose any bin size
              The variables on the x-axis is numerical and quantitive.
* Bar graph : distinct category
              The variables on the x-axis is categorical and qualitative
* Normal distribution has one peak called the mode.
* Positively skewed disctribution : Most values are on the left side than on the right .
## PS 2a: visualizing Data
* The Î£ symbol means the total sum. It is the Greek letter capital sigma. f stands for frequency (count), p stands for proportion.
* With frequency tables, we have exact counts, so we can always create the histogram.But not the opposite way around.
